# Pong Redux
Battle pong, with some breakout shenanigans, fun pixel art backgrounds, and licensed chiptune music.

Primarily a father & son project intended for *eventual* commercial release.

## Roadmap
- Finish in-game features
- Lotsa maps, with very weird shapes and brick-patterns
- GAME MODES: 
   - Teams mode (up to 3 per side)
   - Single player mode with AI opponent
   - Dodgeball. Qty of balls grows over time
